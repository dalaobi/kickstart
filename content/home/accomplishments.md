  High Definition Map Basement Library 

  *  Developed a code library of the following supporting methods like merge points, separate points, distribute points, circular arrangement points, linear arrangement points, point and line combination, lines split, merge, reverse, simplify, separate, etc.
  *  Developed a basement library in Python to load OSM data to an instance planet: judging the parallel line, setting a new node or a line or polygon to the planet, modifying the elements of the planet. 
  *  Developed unit tests and achieved 96% code coverage. This library is used by the entire team to process map features.
  *  Converted this library into node.js for front-end calls.

  By constructing a deep learning model, we predict whether each user will finish viewing each work and whether the work will be praised or not.
   * The final rank is in the top 10%
   * The main model is constructed by xDeepFM which includes Linear, CIN and DNN. 
   * The model and algorithm is realized by Tensorflow (Keras)
